# Final project Debug 🐞🎓 

As new developers we quickly realized that it’s easy to get into negative work habits when spending time so much time in front of a computer. When you’re passionate about what you do it can be hard to drag yourself away from the screen. At least this was our experience, and many seemed to agree, and that is where the idea for DeBug was born. We spend so much time debugging our code every day, so why not DeBug our lives while we’re at it.

It has in fact been proven that focusing on your wellbeing; making sure you move your body, prioritizing your sleep, regularly taking breaks, spending time in nature and making sure you stay hydrated can be very beneficial for you and your work. Leading to a healthier brain and body, an enhanced mood, reduced anxiety and increased self-esteem.

However, when you want to change behavior, jumping headlong into a major goal with both feet is often a waste of time. Instead, make tiny, incremental adjustments until they are part of your muscle memory. By starting small, you can attain big results.This is where we come in, we will gently remind you with our Daily Essentials to take one step at a time towards a smoother and happier day, every day.

This web application was made by Amanda Tilly, Madelene Trang & Fatima Gamero Romero as our final project during the Technigo Frontend Developer boot camp. It is a multipage application where the frontend is built with React, Redux, Thunks and styled with Styled Components. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, mongoose. The web application is deployed with Heroku, MongoDB & Netlify.
